# 🍬 Waybar Floating Pills (Catppuccin Mocha)

A modern, highly-polished Waybar configuration featuring a transparent base with floating, dynamically grouped "pills". It utilizes the beautiful [Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) color palette and sleek minimalist Nerd Font iconography.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Aesthetic "Capsule" Design:** Modules are grouped into standalone floating islands with subtle 3D drop-shadows.
*   **Color-Coded Status Modules:** Quick-glance system metrics styled with distinct, harmonious Catppuccin accents (e.g. Memory is Sapphire, Backlight is Peach).
*   **Media Player Integration (MPRIS):** Displays currently playing media (Spotify, MPV, Firefox, etc.) directly in the left bar.
*   **Optimized Workflows:** Extensive scroll and click bindings on modules (brightness control, volume muting, bluetooth toggling) for rapid execution without needing a full system settings menu.
*   **Intelligent Module Alignment:** Asymmetric padding utilized on unique boundary icons (like the OS logo and the Wifi wedge) to visually center their bounding boxes.

### Note on Fonts
Ensure you have the **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font** installed and set as the default monospace font on your system, or several of the directional and boundary shapes may fail to render correctly!

## 📦 Dependencies
This config invokes several external applications and utilities for its shortcuts. You'll need the following installed for all modules to work flawlessly:
*   `vicinae` - Application launcher toggle
*   `niri` - To switch and manage workspaces (Niri Wayland Compositor)
*   `brightnessctl` - To control screen backlight with the scroll wheel
*   `blueman-manager` *and* `rfkill` - To open the Bluetooth GUI and hardware toggle
*   `pavucontrol` *and* `wpctl` (WirePlumber / PipeWire) - For volume mixer and instant hardware muting
*   `nm-connection-editor` - Network Manager GUI frontend

## 🔧 Installation / Reloading
If you make changes to this `config.jsonc` or its parent `style.css`, simply reload the bar without restarting your display manager by running:

```bash
killall -SIGUSR2 waybar
```
